# uuGle

**uuGle** Chrome extension provides fast and user-friendly searching across Unicorn bookkit books. It uses [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)
 and [Elasticlunr.js](http://elasticlunr.com/) for book indexing and searching.

### Install extension
Plugin is not available in official Chrome store yet, so it must be installed from local directory.
1. Download extension package from and extract it. 
1. Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
1. Turn on *Developer mode*
1. Use Load *Unpacked button* and point to directory with extracted package from pont 1.

## Usage 

1. **uuGle** automatically indexes every book you open. Just open any single page and whole book content will be indexed. 
1. Type "*uu*" in search bar to switch to **uuGle** fulltext search in indexed books.
1. Once in **uuGle** search mode, type any word from page or book title. Most relevant searches are being instantly suggested as you type.
    - You don't need to type whole word, search results are automatically expanded for you.
    - Suggestions are sorted from the most relevant at the top.
    - For each suggestion you can see target book page URL.
    - After **uuGle** suggestions list of othe common Chrome suggestions follows.
    **uuGle** does not replace default search bar behavior.
1. When you select suggestion, corresponding book page will open in currently active browser tab.

## Constraints
This is first released version with following limitations:   
1. Only page name (no page content) is being indexed.
1. Only english language fulltext search is supported.
1. Every book is indexed only once at the moment. Re-indexation need to be implemented to reflect future book content changes.  
1. Performance test with large number of books need to be done.
1. There is no GUI to manage indexing and indexed content.
1. Better icon should be provided to distinguish uuGle and common suggestions. 

## Road map
1. Book already indexed will be automatically re-indexed to reflect book content changes. Based on some timestamp from book data or simple time.
1. GUI to control book indexing - delete index, reindex single book etc.
1. Add breadcrumb path from menu to page name.
1. ...

## Features

This is a basic Chrome Extensions boilerplate to help you write modular and modern Javascript code, load CSS easily and [automatic reload the browser on code changes](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html#automatic-refresh).

This boilerplate is updated with:

- [React 16.13](https://reactjs.org)
- [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)
- [eslint-config-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-react-app)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

This boilerplate is heavily inspired by and adapted from [https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate](https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate), with additional support for React 16.13 features and Webpack 4.

Please open up an issue to nudge me to keep the npm packages up-to-date. FYI, it takes time to make different packages with different versions work together nicely.

## Installing and Running

### Procedures:

1. Check if your [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version is >= **10.13**.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Change the package's `name`, `description`, and `repository` fields in `package.json`.
4. Change the name of your extension on `src/manifest.json`.
5. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
6. Run `npm start`
7. Load your extension on Chrome following:
   1. Access `chrome://extensions/`
   2. Check `Developer mode`
   3. Click on `Load unpacked extension`
   4. Select the `build` folder.
8. Happy hacking.

## Structure

All your extension's code must be placed in the `src` folder.

The boilerplate is already prepared to have a popup, an options page, a background page, and a new tab page (which replaces the new tab page of your browser). But feel free to customize these.

## Webpack auto-reload and HRM

To make your workflow much more efficient this boilerplate uses the [webpack server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) to development (started with `npm start`) with auto reload feature that reloads the browser automatically every time that you save some file in your editor.

You can run the dev mode on other port if you want. Just specify the env var `port` like this:

```
$ PORT=6002 npm run start
```

## Content Scripts

Although this boilerplate uses the webpack dev server, it's also prepared to write all your bundles files on the disk at every code change, so you can point, on your extension manifest, to your bundles that you want to use as [content scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts), but you need to exclude these entry points from hot reloading [(why?)](https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate/issues/4#issuecomment-261788690). To do so you need to expose which entry points are content scripts on the `webpack.config.js` using the `chromeExtensionBoilerplate -> notHotReload` config. Look the example below.

Let's say that you want use the `myContentScript` entry point as content script, so on your `webpack.config.js` you will configure the entry point and exclude it from hot reloading, like this:

```js
{
  …
  entry: {
    myContentScript: "./src/js/myContentScript.js"
  },
  chromeExtensionBoilerplate: {
    notHotReload: ["myContentScript"]
  }
  …
}
```

and on your `src/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://www.google.com/*"],
      "js": ["myContentScript.bundle.js"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Intelligent Code Completion

Thanks to [@hudidit](https://github.com/lxieyang/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react/issues/4)'s kind suggestions, this boilerplate supports chrome-specific intelligent code completion using [@types/chrome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/chrome). For example:

![intellisense](https://lxieyang.github.io/static/chrome-extension-boilerplate-dev-intellisense-ed9e7c485d3eaf66417e5da4748e2c97.png)

## Packing

After the development of your extension run the command

```
$ NODE_ENV=production npm run build
```

Now, the content of `build` folder will be the extension ready to be submitted to the Chrome Web Store. Just take a look at the [official guide](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish) to more infos about publishing.

## Secrets

If you are developing an extension that talks with some API you probably are using different keys for testing and production. Is a good practice you not commit your secret keys and expose to anyone that have access to the repository.

To this task this boilerplate import the file `./secrets.<THE-NODE_ENV>.js` on your modules through the module named as `secrets`, so you can do things like this:

_./secrets.development.js_

```js
export default { key: '123' };
```

_./src/popup.js_

```js
import secrets from 'secrets';
ApiCall({ key: secrets.key });
```

:point_right: The files with name `secrets.*.js` already are ignored on the repository.
